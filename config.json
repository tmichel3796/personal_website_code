      "<h3>Who Am I?</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! My name is Trevor, and welcome to my website. One of my driving forces in life is the joy of discovery. Although, to a certain extent, discovering existing things is a bit boring to me. Instead, I like finding things that no one else has either seen nor heard of before and the associated problem solving. The only downside I have discovered with this is a distinctive loss of hair. However, when you combine that joy of discovery with a general interest in computer technology, I eventually decided on becoming a data scientist for my career. Since making this decision, I decided to focus my education on machine learning with a focus on advanced analytical techniques. I will graduate from Winona State University in May of 2026 with my Bachelor's in Data Science.</p>",
      "<h3>Professional Experience</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Fastenal Data Support Analyst, I feel I am right at home with what I want to be doing. Every day involves solving a new puzzle and I truly never know what is going to be asked of me. Meanwhile, the data reports I assemble are able to have lasting impact on the way Fastenal operates. Before Fastenal, I had a two-year stint as a call center agent where I had the opportunity to work in leadership for a fortune 500 furniture company. As a result, I have had years of practice in explaining complicated ideas while breaking them into their simplest elements to augment better understanding.</p>",
      "<h3>Hobbies</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer I enjoy whitewater kayaking, camping, biking, and going on walks. In the winter I love snowmobiling, playing board games, and reading.</p>"
